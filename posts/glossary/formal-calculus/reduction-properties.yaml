concept: 
    name: a reduction-terminating calculus
    definition: a calculus where application of derivation rules, applied in any order, will eventually result in a reduced form
    conventional_name: a strongly normalizing rewriting system


concept:
    name: a reduction-semi-terminating calculus
    definition: a calculus where application of derivation rules will only result in a reduced form if applied in a particular ordered
    conventional_name: a weakly normalizing rewriting system


concept:
    name: deferred-reduction form
    definition: an expression where its outermost part is not reducible but its innermost part may or may not be
    conventional_name: a weak-head normal form


concept:
    name: reduction by evaluation
    definition: using a meta-calculus to evaluate an expression in the target calculus instead of applying the target calculus's derivation rules
    conventional_name: normalization by evaluation


concept:
    name: a calculus with canonicity
    definition: a calculus where every expression can be reduced to a canonical form

concept:
    name: todo
    definition: a property of a calculus, such that every expression is either a value or can be reduced by one step
    inferior_name: property of progress

concept:
    name: uniqueness of normal forms 
    definition: any order of reduction rules will ultimately result in the same normal form
    inferior_names:
        - Church-Rosser property
        - confluence


concept:
    name: type-preserving reduction
    definition: a property of a calculus in which applying derivation rules preserves the type of the expressions
    inferior_names: 
        - subject reduction
        - preservation
