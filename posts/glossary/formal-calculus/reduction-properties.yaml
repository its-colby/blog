"a reduction-terminating calculus":
    definition: a calculus where application of derivation rules, applied in any order, will eventually result in a reduced form
    conventional_name: a strongly normalizing rewriting system


"a reduction-semi-terminating calculus":
    definition: a calculus where application of derivation rules will only result in a reduced form if applied in a particular ordered
    conventional_name: a weakly normalizing rewriting system


"deferred-reduction form":
    definition: an expression where its outermost part is not reducible but its innermost part may or may not be
    conventional_name: a weak-head normal form


"reduction by evaluation":
    definition: using a meta-calculus to evaluate an expression in the target calculus instead of applying the target calculus's derivation rules
    conventional_name: normalization by evaluation


"a calculus with canonicity":
    definition: a calculus where every expression can be reduced to a canonical form


"property of progress":
    definition: a property of a calculus, such that every expression is either a value or can be reduced by one step
    inferior_name: property of progress


"uniqueness of normal forms":
    definition: any order of reduction rules will ultimately result in the same normal form
    inferior_names:
        - Church-Rosser property
        - confluence


"type-preserving reduction":
    definition: a property of a calculus in which applying derivation rules preserves the type of the expressions
    inferior_names: 
        - subject reduction
        - preservation
