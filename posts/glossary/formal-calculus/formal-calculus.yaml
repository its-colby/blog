"a (formal) calculus":
    definition: a formal language equipped with a set of rules that specify how an expression can be derived from other expressions
    conflated_concept: an algebra
    other_conventional_names: 
        - a formal system
        - a term rewriting system


"a reduction rule":
    definition: a derivation rule in a calculus that represents the act of simplification or reduction, most often substitution or cancelling out
    other_conventional_name: a conversion rule


"a formation rule":
    definition: a derivation rule in a calculus that represents the act of constructing a new expression from other expressions


"a reduced form":
    definition: an expression in a calculus where no derivation rules apply
    conventional_name: normal form


"a canonical form":
    definition: a distinguished expression in a calculus that best characterizes a particular value of its kind

"erasure":
    definition: the removal of syntax related to any rule besides reduction. used for computation as opposed to type checking
