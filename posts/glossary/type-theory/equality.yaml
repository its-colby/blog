concept:
    name: an identity type
    definition: a type that depends on another type (lets call it the object type), whose terms are proofs of equality between two terms of the object type. an instance of propositional equality that is type specific


concept:
    name: reflection type
    definition: an implementation of an identity type where the only constructor is reflection


concept:
    name: proof irrelevance
    definition: the identity type with respect to two terms is a singleton, usually the case with reflection type


concept:
    name: proof relevance
    definition: the identity type with respect to two terms is not a singleton, usually the case with path types


concept:
    name: equality reflection
    definiton: if two terms of the same type are propositionally equal, then they should be treated as definitionally equal
