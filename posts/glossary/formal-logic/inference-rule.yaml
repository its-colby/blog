"a premise":
    definition: an input to an inference rule or application of an inference rule


"a conclusion":
    definition: an output to an inference rule of application of an inference rule


"an assertion-level inference rule":
    definition: an inference rule whose premeses and conclusion only depend on the assertion language
    conventional_name: a structural rule


"a statement-level inference rule":
    definition: an inference rule whose premses and conclusion only depend on the statement language
    conventional_name: a logical rule


"an axiom":
    definition: an inference rule with no premeses


"an auxiliary inference rule":
    definition: an inference rule, usually a statement-level axiom, supplemented to the inference calculus in order to prove more results about a specific domain, usually mathematics
    conventional_names:
        - a non-logical axiom
        - a proper axiom


"a fundamental inference rule":
    definition: an inference rule that is not auxiliary
    conventional_name: a logical axiom


"an axiom schema":
    definition: a rule of inference that has hypotheses/premeses
