concept:
    name: a premise
    definition: an input to an inference rule or application of an inference rule


concept:
    name: a conclusion
    definition: an output to an inference rule of application of an inference rule


concept:
    name: an assertion-level inference rule
    definition: an inference rule whose premeses and conclusion only depend on the assertion language
    conventional_name: a structural rule


concept:
    name: a statement-level inference rule
    definition: an inference rule whose premses and conclusion only depend on the statement language
    conventional_name: a logical rule


concept:
    name: an axiom
    definition: an inference rule with no premeses


concept:
    name: an auxiliary inference rule
    definition: an inference rule, usually a statement-level axiom, supplemented to the inference calculus in order to prove more results about a specific domain, usually mathematics
    conventional_names:
        - a non-logical axiom
        - a proper axiom


concept:
    name: a fundamental inference rule
    definition: an inference rule that is not auxiliary
    conventional_name: a logical axiom


axiom_schema:
    definitions:
        - a rule of inference that has hypotheses/premeses
