    terms:
        - substructural proof theory
    definitions:
        - cant decide between 1, a field that studies the proof calculi of substructural logics, or 2, a field that studies analytic-ness of proof calculi


concept:
    name: an inference calculus
    definition: a 2-sorted calculus, where 1 sort represents statements, another sort represents asserted statements, and rules specify how to derive an assertion from other assertions

concept:
    name: a statement language
    definition: the language within an inference calculus that is used to express statements

concept:
    name: an assertion language
    definition: the language within an inference calculus that is used to expression the assertion of a statement(s)

concept:
    name: a 1-sorted inference calculus
    definition: an inference calculus where the statement language and assertion language are one in the same
