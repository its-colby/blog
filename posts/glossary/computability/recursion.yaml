concept:
    name: fixed-point
    definition: an input to a function that does not change. input = output


concept:
    name: fixed-point combinator
    definition: a higher-order combinator (takes func. as arg.) that is a fixed-point of its own arg


concept:
    name: unrestricted recursion
    definition: recursion that may not terminate. fixed-point combinators are an example
    inferior_name: general recursion


concept:
    name: Y combinator
    definition: a particular impl. of a fixed-point combinator. 


concept:
    name: well-founded recurion
    definition: there is some relation/ordering that guarantees each recursive call is on a smaller element


concept:
    name: structural recursion
    definition: recrusive calls only made on substructures of the argument


concept:
    name: strict positivity
    definition: a self-reference must only appear as output, never input

concept:
    name: recursor
    definition: synonym for elimination rule of a particular w type / inductive type, or more boradly i guess, any function that shows what to do next


concept: 
    name: corecursion
    definitoin: each call produces a value plus another awaited call


concept:
    name: guarded recursion
    definition: a measure to ensure corecursion halts


concept:
    name: combinatory logic
    definition: essentially lambda calc but only with combinations of a few primitive combinators
