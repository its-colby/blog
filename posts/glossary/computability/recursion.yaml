"fixed-point":
    definition: an input to a function that does not change. input = output


"fixed-point combinator":
    definition: a higher-order combinator (takes func. as arg.) that is a fixed-point of its own arg


"unrestricted recursion":
    definition: recursion that may not terminate. fixed-point combinators are an example
    inferior_name: general recursion


"Y combinator":
    definition: a particular impl. of a fixed-point combinator. 


"well-founded recursion":
    definition: there is some relation/ordering that guarantees each recursive call is on a smaller element


"structural recursion":
    definition: recrusive calls only made on substructures of the argument


"strict positivity":
    definition: a self-reference must only appear as output, never input

"recursor":
    definition: synonym for elimination rule of a particular w type / inductive type, or more boradly i guess, any function that shows what to do next


"corecursion":
    definitoin: each call produces a value plus another awaited call


"guarded recursion":
    definition: a measure to ensure corecursion halts


"combinatory logic":
    definition: essentially lambda calc but only with combinations of a few primitive combinators
