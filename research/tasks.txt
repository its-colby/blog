Theories
- the purpose of women in man's life
- how best to cold approach women
- how best to plan dates with women
- how best to escalate emotions with women
- the purpose of life
- the methods of creating objectively good romantic music
- theory of orchestration
- how best to develop a product
- with more study of cognitive psychology, I'm confident a few theories will ignite from ideas on hierarchy, motivation, deduction, working memory limits, enumeration, and certainty
- how best to train fitness
- general principles for any sport
- sport-specific hierarchies and principles (freestyle/folkstyle/greco-roman wrestling, judo, bjj, mma, lacrosse, climbing, badminton, baseball, billiards, swimming, running, parkour, sprinting, jumping)
- predicting civilization via geography and geography via plate tectonics
- principles of communication and writing, drawing on peikoffs and rands work
- theory of fiction writing
- developing a personal "standard/specification" for your ideal woman to help with the selection process
- study of banter and humor. use theo von and chris destefano septermber podcast as case study
- catalog emotions and other emotions in relationships 
- theory of cause of emotions
- theory of style and fashion with respect to clothing
- how to text well. how to converse well. not necessarily banter. using emojies. staying positive. using gifs. etc
- theory about education, namely, how due to the rise of online tools, the only reason to formally register for a course and therefore a university or school is skill development not for actually learning and even then skill development is minimal perhaps do
- theory about government legislation, republic, and bureaucracy and Elonâ€™s proposal of having all laws have a time limit that need to be in which they need to be reinstated. Also, how from administration to administration what happens to bureaucratic rules furthermore the conflation between a representative for a political party and their ability to manage bureaucratic rules.


Useful Practices
- defining and contrasting synonymous terms
- morphological trees of russian and latin/english words
- hierarchies within formal logic; the field is a mess as it stands
- eliminating much of redundant math (many equally-expressive structures, less-generalizable proofs, etc)
- biomechanics of every exercise
- analysis of particular classical pieces according to my theory
- analysis of sport matches according to my hierarchies and principles
- refactoring functions and files to read better


Product/Feature Ideas
- more dynamically-loaded aspects of videos, so that videos can be updated instead of entirely replaced


Research Ideas & Hypotheses
- create a mapping from cognitive structures to mathematical structures in order to obtain the ability to mathematically reason about cognition
- create a formal language for structuring knowledge. perhaps use this for LLM encodings
- create a metric and perhaps a corresponding linter, that measures strain on working memory, likely comparing breadth and depth of AST (w/ respect to a certain function, class, etc) to pre-established ranges of working memory
- how do you make formal methods more usable and integrated into regular development flow?
- how to make proof assistants type-check faster?
- there seems to be a lack of composability and generalization within philosophy, in other words, generalizing the outward-facing properties of a "theory of knowledge" for instance or a "theory of life", in order for other people to build theories that remain agnostic to particular "ground-level theories" and only depend on a few properties of them. kind of like how in math, group theory doesnt depend on a particular set or type theory.


Hot Takes via My Intuition
- I believe that both the limit on working memory and on long-term memory, is (and should be) the sole (or primary) causal factor behind the way we attempt to structure knowledge. I believe its importance is massively underrated and its lack of recognition has severely minimized intellectual progress of the individual and of society.
- I believe that the memory limits are the reason for half the innovation in the sciences, the other half being usefulness. 
- I believe that complete enumeration may be the only means to achieving certainty.
- My intuition leads me to believe that the heart of reasoning is in the concepts we choose to recognize, and that, if our concepts were good enough, all theorems could be obvious deductions from their definitions, thus shifting the task from proof to definition.
- Perhaps interactive proof assistants should be useless, and other methods should be used to develop math and algorithms in such a way that lends itself only to automated proofs
- love is such a poor concept. however, there clearly is some initial infatuation sometimes. lets try and define that and find a good word for it


Motivations
- motivate hierarchies, not by monetizing them, but putting myself in a position to sound smarter in interviews and networking







math, form log, cog pysch, th. cs, 

using math to code

Library management and reuse: Handling huge formal libraries without overwhelming the user with search or notational inconsistencies.
Proof comprehension: How do humans understand long formal proofs, and what visualization / chunking strategies reduce cognitive overload?
