2nd most important tool besides factorization
pythag. fact.
prove def. or alg. int. is ring
work through proofs of number fields to alg ints
field ext. of two added roots from two monic polys
for each number field to alg int, look at bases
prove that q isnt finitely gen. z module
prove q has 1 fin. gen. module which is z
number fields may have many fin. gen. z mods., but ring of alg ints is maximal
one???
a fractional ideal that is subset of number field is fin. gen. alg. int. -
module
fractional ideals form group
decompose rings via principal ideals and group of units
finiteness of class group - non principal fractional ideals are finite
unit group of alg. ints. is fin. gen. ab. gp.
degree of number field is num of embeddings into C
can reason about finiteness of class group when trying to factor fermats last
theorem and get a better decomposition
orthogonal group of quadratic form
orthogonal group in general linear group

2nd tool is reduction mod prime ideal
what led hensel to p adic nums, chinese rem th of red mod m, reduce my powers of
prime p
also about kernel of reduction map of integral domain being injective and zeta
zp is int. dom. and metric space and complete (cauchy seq. conv.), compact, and
topological ring, top. ring, means all ring ops are continous
you can solve over q or over r if you can solve over completions. hosse
principle
