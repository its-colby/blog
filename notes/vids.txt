def. of abs. val.
abs. val. def. w/ resp. to integral domain
abs. val. induces a metric
finite fields only have trivial abs. val.
def. of non-Archimedean absolute value (ultrametric)
def. of place
def. of completion
def. of valuation
Ostrowski's theorem
Another theorem of Alexander Ostrowski has it that any field complete with respect to an Archimedean absolute value is isomorphic to either the real or the complex numbers, and the valuation is equivalent to the usual one
